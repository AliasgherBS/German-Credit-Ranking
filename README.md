# German-Credit-Ranking

The German Credit data set (available at ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases/statlog/) contains observations on 30 variables for 1000 past applicants for credit. Each applicant was rated as “good credit” (700 cases) or “bad credit” (300 cases).


New applicants for credit can also be evaluated on these 30 "predictor" variables. We want to develop a credit scoring rule that can be used to determine if a new applicant is a good credit risk or a bad credit risk, based on values for one or more of the predictor variables.


Data was diveded randomly into training (60%) and validation (40%) partitions, and classification models were developed using the following data mining techniques in XLMiner:
• Logistic regression
• Classification trees
• Neural networks
• Discriminant Analysis.


Then further visualizations are provided to recognize the trends, gain meaningful inisghts and provide more information on which predictor variables are the most significant ones. The notebook provides dexcription with every code provided to understand how with just the data we moved towards data driven decision making.
